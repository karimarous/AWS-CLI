To get list of all command available in each tier:
aws s3 help
aws s3api help


I)Using S3 commands:
1)Managing bucket:
a)Create a Bucket:
aws s3 mb s3://bucket-name

b)Listing your buckets:
aws s3 ls

c)Delete a bucket:
*Empty bucket
aws s3 rb s3://bucket-name
*Not empty bucket(if you are are using a versioned bucked that contains previously deleted but retained objects,you must first remove all of the content
aws s3 rb s3://bucket-name --force


2)Managing objects:
Failed uploads can't be resumed .If the multipart upload fails due to a timeout or is manually canceled by pressing Ctrl+C, the AWS CLI cleans up any files created and aborts the upload.
If the process is interrupted by a kill command or system system failure ,the in-progress remains in Amazon S3 and you must clean it by:
*Console ->S3
*s3api abort-multipart-upload 
a)Copy file to s3:
aws s3 cp file.txt s3://my-bucket/ --grants read=uri=http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers full=emailaddress=user@example.com full=id=258745878545

--storage-class REDUCED_REDUNDANCY

b)Sync :aws s3 sync <source> <target> [--options]

*sync without delete:
aws s3 sync . s3://my-bucket/path
upload: MySubdirectory\MyFile3.txt to s3://my-bucket/path/MySubdirectory/MyFile3.txt
upload: MyFile2.txt to s3://my-bucket/path/MyFile2.txt
upload: MyFile1.txt to s3://my-bucket/path/MyFile1.txt

*sync with delete
-aws s3 sync . s3://my-bucket/path --delete
delete: s3://my-bucket/path/MyFile1.txt

-aws s3 sync s3://my-bucket/path . --delete
delete: s3://my-bucket/path/MyFile1.txt

-aws s3 sync s3://karim/path s3://my-bucket/path --delete
delete: s3://my-bucket/path/MyFile1.txt

*sync with IA storage class:
aws s3 sync . s3://my-bucket/path --storage-class STANDARD_IA

*option
--exclude "*.txt"
--include "myfile?.txt"
--storage-class STANDARD_IA
--delete
--acl public-read (or public-write or public-read-write)
--recursive

c)Copy:
aws s3 cp MyFile.txt s3://my-bucket/path/

d)Move:
aws s3 mv s3://my-bucket/path ./MyDirectory 

e)Delete object:
aws s3 rm s3://my-bucket/path/MySubdirectory/MyFile3.txt
delete: s3://my-bucket/path/MySubdirectory/MyFile3.txt

f)List all objects and folders:
aws s3 ls s3://bucket-name
aws s3 ls s3://bucket-name/path/

II)Using S3api commands:
1)Applying a custom ACL
aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket MyBucket --grant-full-control 'emailaddress="user1@example.com",emailaddress="user2@example.com"' --grant-read 'uri="http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers"'

2)Configuring a Logging Policy:
aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket MyBucket --grant-read-acp 'URI="http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/s3/LogDelivery"' --grant-write 'URI="http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/s3/LogDelivery"'
aws s3api put-bucket-logging --bucket MyBucket --bucket-logging-status file://logging.json
Output:
{
  "LoggingEnabled": {
    "TargetBucket": "MyBucket",
    "TargetPrefix": "MyBucketLogs/",
    "TargetGrants": [
      {
        "Grantee": {
          "Type": "AmazonCustomerByEmail",
          "EmailAddress": "user@example.com"
        },
        "Permission": "FULL_CONTROL"
      },
      {
    "Grantee": {
          "Type": "Group",
          "URI": "http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers"
        },
        "Permission": "READ"
      }
    ]
  }
}
